    "## What is *League of Legends* and why are we interested in its victors?\n",
    "\n",
    "*League of Legends* is a widely popular video game with a large folowing of their competitive scene and backed by the lore created by its company Riot Games that now spans four hugely popular games, multiple books, and a recent Netflix Series. All of this started as the creation of a video game in a then budding genre called Multiplayer Online Battle Arena, or MOBA. The MOBA genre has now exploded into becoming an over 300 million dollar industry with major e-sports contracts, worldwide competition, and events watched by more than some sports championships. *League of Legends* makes up two-thirds of the market share for this genre.\n",
    "\n",
    "With this huge interest and low barrier of entry to the game, nearly every watcher has delved into playing at least a few games of League of Legends. And though some people are driven away by the toxic community, poor tutorials, or terrible networking code, there are multitudes more drawn in by the game's complexity, strategic depth, and competition. The game works on a ranked system, and in a world where time is money, people want to know whether a game is worth continuing or if it would be better to forfeit and move on to the next game. This brings us to our current question, predicting victors based on early game statistics."

    "## What early game statistics can we check?\n",
    "\n",
    "Though *League of Legends* is a complex game with many strategic options that can even vary at the ranks of the competitive ladder, there is consistent things that are viewable at each and every rank. Though some of these features may vary in importance depending on rank, the presence and potential quantities of the features themselves is consistent due to the bounds of the game.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Summary features\n",
    "Each of these features are provided in a match summary format by the client. The featuers we have chosen are defined as being observable by a player on the loading screen. All three of these features is repeated once for each of the players for a total of ten times per feature.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Champion\n",
    "The champion a player selects represents the character that they are using. This determines to a degree their playstyle for the match, the other features they may select, as well as the abilities available to them.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Summoner Spell\n",
    "This feature represents one of the special skills taken by the player, called a summoner spell. Though players can select two of these spells, nearly all players select one called Flash and a secondary spell of their choice. Thus, to limit the amount of features, the flash summoner spell has been removed from the listing. A full description of each summoner spell and their uses can be found here: https://dignitas.gg/articles/blogs/Unknown/14425/an-overview-guide-to-summoner-spells-in-lol\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Keystone Rune\n",
    "As part of the game, each palyer creates what is known as a rune page. Though this can produce highly variable results with the amount of potential combinations, it is impossible to tell someone's full rune page until after the game has concluded. What you can easily see is the keystone rune selected by a given player. This is the rune with the most impact from those selected, and can drastically how a palyer wants to approach fighting against the player.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Snapshot Features\n",
    "These features are taken in three snapshots at five, ten, and fifteen minutes into the game. Each feature is duplicated, once to each team.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Team Gold\n",
    "This is the total currency that the team has gained. Gold is generated passively as well as through various smaller and larger objectives. To ensure that there isn't too many features, the smaller features are lumped together in the total team gold. This can be considered the team's overall \"score\" in a sense.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Team Kills\n",
    "This is the total amount of kills that a team has gotten. Though a kill does result in gold, it also results in taking a player out of the game temporarily and allowing the killing team to potentially take advantage of that player's temporary displacement.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Towers Destroyed\n",
    "This is the amount of towers destroyed by the team. Towers are structures that shoot powerful projectiles at enemies, and are present in the open areas of the map. Though it is not common for many towers to be destroyed before the first fifteen minutes have elapsed, should one fall the players who have lost the tower will be losing significant amounts of control over that area of the map and allowing their enemies to apply much more pressure. See this article for a full explanation about League of Legends Towers, also known as Turrets: https://en.number13.de/league-of-legends-turret-aggro-and-everything-you-need-to-know-about-turrets/\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Dragons Killed\n",
    "One of the significant neutral objectives is known as the Dragon. These are creatures that, when killed, will give the team a small but not insignificant buff. This cumulates when players kill four dragons and gain what is known as the dragon, a large buff that can strongly influence the way that the game goes. The dragon soul is not attainable within 15 minutes, but it is possible to make significant progress towards the dragon soul and gaining the smaller buffs can make a difference. For a more in-depth explanation about the dragons, you can refer to this article: https://win.gg/news/everything-you-need-to-know-about-lols-dragons-and-drakes/\n",
    "\n",
    "Please note that the article is somewhat out of date as of recent updates, but the premise of what the dragons can give is the same.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Rift Heralds Killed\n",
    "Another of the Neutral monsters available in early game is known as the rift herald. This creature, when killed, gives the killer a temporary ability allowing them to summon the creature to fight for them until killed. When summoned, this creature will charge at nearby towers, dealing massive damage to them and allowign them to put significant pressure on the map. As such, it is very important for early game pressure to get the rift herald if possible. There can only be two rift heralds that spawn in any given game, as its spawn area is taken over by a more powerful monster at the twenty minute mark, but it is marginally possible for both of those to be killed within the first fifteen minutes. For a slightly more in-depth explanation about the rift herald and its uses, you can watch this short video on the topic: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ISWm8hNz4Xk\n"

    "The data used for this has been collected using the riot api and parsed using custom Python3 code. Due to API limitations, we have maintained the number of matches at 12,000 valid matches. For a further studyt, more matches in more varied ranks could be used, but for now to keep computational burdens relatively low, I have kept at that number.
